Fraud Detection Analysis Using DuckDB and Python

Problem Statement :
Fraudulent activities pose a significant threat to financial institutions and online platforms. Detecting and preventing fraud is crucial to safeguarding users' assets and maintaining trust in the system. However, manual analysis of transaction data for fraud detection is time-consuming and error-prone. Therefore, there is a need for automated tools and techniques to efficiently identify suspicious activities.

Solution Overview:
This project focuses on leveraging DuckDB, an analytical SQL database, and Python to perform fraud detection analysis on transaction data. The solution includes the following components:

Data Loading: Connects to DuckDB and loads transaction data from a CSV file.

SQL Queries: Executes SQL queries to extract insights such as total transactions, average transaction amounts by category, top merchants, gender distribution of customers, and potential fraudulent transactions.

Data Visualization: Uses matplotlib to create visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, and histograms to represent the analysis results.

Automated Analysis: Implements automated analysis techniques to identify potential fraudulent transactions based on predefined thresholds and criteria.


Why Choose This Solution?
Efficiency: DuckDB provides fast and efficient SQL querying capabilities, enabling quick analysis of large datasets.

Flexibility: Python offers a flexible and powerful environment for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization, making it ideal for fraud detection tasks.

Integration: The integration of DuckDB and Python allows seamless execution of SQL queries and data processing tasks within the same environment.

Scalability: The solution is scalable and can handle increasing volumes of transaction data, making it suitable for real-world applications.

Accuracy: Automated fraud detection algorithms and thresholds help improve the accuracy of identifying potential fraudulent activities.
