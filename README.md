**Project Title: DuckDB Analysis with Python and Kaggle Data**

**Description:**

This project demonstrates how to leverage Python and DuckDB for data analysis using a sample dataset from Kaggle. It showcases essential steps involved in:

Data Acquisition: Downloading a dataset from Kaggle using Python libraries.
Data Exploration: Employing DuckDB's in-memory SQL capabilities to perform data exploration and analysis.
Query Execution: Executing various SQL queries on the dataset using DuckDB's Python interface.
Output Display: Presenting the query results within your VS Code console.


**Prerequisites:**

Python (version 3.x recommended)
DuckDB 
Kaggle API credentials or A Valid Kaggle Dataset
A code editor or IDE Vs code is Recommended 
Installation:

**Install required libraries:**

pip install duckdb kaggle
Create a Kaggle API token and set the KAGGLE_USERNAME and KAGGLE_KEY environment variables 

**Usage:**

Clone or download this repository.
Open the project directory in your VS Code or preferred IDE.
Replace the placeholder dataset name ('your_dataset_name'') in the script.py file with the actual Kaggle dataset you want to use.
Run the script:

python script.py

**Expected Output:**

The script will execute a series of sample SQL queries on the downloaded dataset and display the results directly in your VS Code console. These queries might include:

Selecting specific columns
Filtering data based on conditions
Performing aggregations (e.g., counting, summing)
Joining tables (if applicable)
