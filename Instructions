1. Create a virtual environment for Python:
   python -m venv myenv

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   source myenv/bin/activate  (Linux/macOS)
   .\myenv\Scripts\activate    (Windows)

3. Install requirements from requirements.txt:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Download the dataset from Kaggle:
   Go to https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kelvinkelue/credit-card-fraud-prediction?resource=download
   Download the dataset file.
5. Make sure to replace file path in script.py withyour download file location
6. Run script.py:
   python script.py


Troubleshooting Tips:

If the virtual environment activation fails, try recreating the environment or check for any system environment variable conflicts.
If downloading the Kaggle dataset manually, confirm that you have the correct file format and place it in the correct directory.
When running the script, look for error messages indicating missing dependencies or incorrect file paths, and address them accordingly.
Keep your virtual environment clean by deactivating it (deactivate command) after completing your task.
