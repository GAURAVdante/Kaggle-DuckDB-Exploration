# Running Python Programs with SQL Queries Using DuckDB

In this guide, we will walk through the process of setting up and running Python programs that involve executing SQL queries using DuckDB. The code examples provided in this guide have been improved by using tools like isort and Flake8 for code formatting and linting.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

1. Python: You can download and install Python from the official website [python.org](https://www.python.org).

2. Visual Studio Code (VSCode) or any other code editor of your choice.

Install the required packages by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

pip install -r requirements.txt

If you prefer using Poetry for dependency management and virtual environments, you can install it using the following commands:

curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python -

pip install poetry

## Setting Up the Project

1. Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it:


   mkdir duckdb_project

   cd duckdb_project

2. Initialize a new Poetry project (if using Poetry):

   poetry init

   Follow the prompts to fill in project information.

3. Add dependencies to your Poetry project (if using Poetry):

   poetry add pandas matplotlib pydantic duckdb

4. Create the following files in your project directory:

   - main.py: Contains the main code to run SQL queries and process data.

   - query_functions.py: Contains functions to execute SQL queries using DuckDB.

   - plotting_functions.py: Contains functions to plot data using matplotlib.

   - database.py: Contains functions to connect to DuckDB and create tables.

## Code Improvements

isort and Flake8

We have improved our code by using isort for import sorting and Flake8 for code linting. Ensure you have these tools installed (`pip install isort flake8`) and configured in your VSCode settings for seamless code formatting and linting.

## Running the Program

1. Open your code editor and navigate to your project directory.

2. Activate your virtual environment if you created one (if using Poetry):

   poetry shell

3. Run the main Python script:

   python main.py

## Adding a New SQL Query

To add a new SQL query, follow these steps:

1. Open query_functions.py in your code editor.

2. Create a new function to execute your SQL query. Ensure you pass the DuckDB connection (con) as an argument to the function.

3. Update the main.py file to call your new function and handle the results accordingly.

For detailed instructions on adding your own SQL query, refer to the "Add Your SQL Query.txt" file included in the project.

## pdoc Documentation

We have also generated documentation for our code using pdoc. After installing pdoc (`pip install pdoc3`), you can generate documentation for your code using the command:

pdoc module.py

Replace module.py with the path to your Python module.

To view the generated documentation, open the generated HTML files in a web browser.

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you should now have a better understanding of how to set up and run Python programs with SQL queries using DuckDB. Additionally, you have learned about tools like isort and Flake8 for improving code formatting and linting, which are essential for maintaining clean and organized codebases.

For detailed instructions on how to run the code and make modifications, refer to the "Instructions.txt" file included in the project.
