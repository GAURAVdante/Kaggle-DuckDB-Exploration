Add the SQL Query:

Open query_functions.py in your code editor.
Create a new function to execute your SQL query. Ensure you pass the DuckDB connection (con) as an argument to the function.
Here's an example query to get the total transaction amount by category:

def total_transaction_amount_by_category(con):
    query = "SELECT category, SUM(amt) AS total_amount FROM data GROUP BY category"
    result = con.execute(query).fetchall()
    return result
Update main.py:

Import the new function from query_functions.py:

from query_functions import total_transaction_amount_by_category
Call the new function with the DuckDB connection (con) and handle the results:

# Assuming you already have con defined and connected to DuckDB
total_transaction_amount = total_transaction_amount_by_category(con)
Plotting the Results:

Open plotting_functions.py in your code editor.
Create a new function to plot the results using matplotlib. You can customize the plot as needed.
Here's an example function to plot total transaction amount by category:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def plot_total_transaction_amount_by_category(data):
    categories = [row[0] for row in data]
    amounts = [row[1] for row in data]

    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.bar(categories, amounts, color='lightcoral')
    plt.xlabel('Category')
    plt.ylabel('Total Amount')
    plt.title('Total Transaction Amount by Category')
    plt.xticks(rotation=45)
    plt.show()
Update main.py to Plot:

Import the new plotting function from plotting_functions.py:

from plotting_functions import plot_total_transaction_amount_by_category
Call the plotting function with the data retrieved from the SQL query:

plot_total_transaction_amount_by_category(total_transaction_amount)
Execute main.py:

Ensure you have a valid connection to DuckDB in database.py and that you've executed the necessary setup queries.
Run python main.py in your terminal or command prompt to execute the program.
This guide assumes you have the necessary Python packages installed (duckdb, matplotlib, etc.) and that you've set up your project structure as mentioned earlier in the guide. 
Adjust the code snippets according to your specific SQL query and plotting requirements.
