# Adding Your Own SQL Query

Follow these steps to add your own SQL query and plot the results in your Python program using DuckDB and matplotlib:

## Add the SQL Query

1. Open `query_functions.py` in your code editor.

2. Create a new function to execute your SQL query. Make sure to pass the DuckDB connection (`con`) as an argument to the function.

Example :

   def total_transaction_amount_by_category(con):
       query = "SELECT category, SUM(amt) AS total_amount FROM data GROUP BY category"
       result = con.execute(query).fetchall()
       return result

## Update `main.py`

1. Import the new function from `query_functions.py`.

   from query_functions import total_transaction_amount_by_category

2. Call the new function with the DuckDB connection (`con`) and handle the results.

   # Assuming you already have 'con' defined and connected to DuckDB
   total_transaction_amount = total_transaction_amount_by_category(con)

## Plotting the Results

1. Open `plotting_functions.py` in your code editor.

2. Create a new function to plot the results using matplotlib. Customize the plot as needed.

   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   def plot_total_transaction_amount_by_category(data):
       categories = [row[0] for row in data]
       amounts = [row[1] for row in data]

       plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
       plt.bar(categories, amounts, color='lightcoral')
       plt.xlabel('Category')
       plt.ylabel('Total Amount')
       plt.title('Total Transaction Amount by Category')
       plt.xticks(rotation=45)
       plt.show()
   

## Update `main.py` to Plot

1. Import the new plotting function from `plotting_functions.py`.

   from plotting_functions import plot_total_transaction_amount_by_category

2. Call the plotting function with the data retrieved from the SQL query.

   plot_total_transaction_amount_by_category(total_transaction_amount)

## Execute the Program

1. Ensure you have a valid connection to DuckDB in `database.py`, and you've executed the necessary setup queries.

2. Run `python main.py` in your terminal or command prompt to execute the program.

This guide assumes you have the necessary Python packages installed (duckdb, matplotlib, etc.) and that you've set up your project structure as mentioned earlier in the guide. Adjust the code snippets according to your specific SQL query and plotting requirements.
